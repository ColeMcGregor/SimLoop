# SimLoop
Mini Race is a compact racing game where each run creates a new short track. Cars are driven by swappable controllers: player, baseline bot, or machine-learning bot. Physics keep it light but believable, with drifting at speed and boundaries that slow you down. Every lap is data, every run a test of skill or code. Has swappable vehicle controllers.
