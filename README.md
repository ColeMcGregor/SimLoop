# SimLoop

SimLoop is a small-scale racing sandbox where cars compete on procedurally generated tracks.
Each vehicle can be controlled by different controllers â€” a human player, a baseline algorithm, or a machine learning model. The game supports one or two vehicles per race, enabling head-to-head comparisons of algorithms or player versus player matches.

Features

 - Procedural Track Generation
    - Each run generates a new closed-loop track.
    - Track defined by a centerline and width, ensuring consistent physics and AI reference frames.

 - Extensible Controllers
    - PlayerController: keyboard or gamepad input.
    - BaselineController: a simple algorithm such as pure pursuit.
    - MLController: connects to external machine learning models.
    - ReplayController: record and replay laps as ghosts.

- Two-Vehicle Competition

    - Spawn two cars on the same track.
    - Assign any controller type to each car.
    - Compare lap times, racing lines, and interactions directly.
    - Supports player vs. player, player vs. bot, or bot vs. bot.

- Lightweight Physics

    - Kinematic car model with acceleration, braking, and steering.
    - Lateral drift when turning at high speed.
    - Boundary collisions clamp the car inside the track and reduce speed.

 - Lap Timing & Data

    - Checkpoints and lap counters for each vehicle.
    - Individual lap times and summaries stored per race.
    - Direct comparison between controller strategies.
